# Dynamic Avatar + AI Interaction Demo

This is a prototype project for Autism Routine & AI-Enhanced Avatar System.

## Demo Overview
This project aims to develop a motion-based, cartoon-style avatar with realistic yet child-friendly eyes and mouth (not representing a real person). The avatar will integrate a simple
AI-driven interaction flow designed for autistic children. The prototype will demonstrate
your team’s ability to combine animation, interaction logic, and AI responsiveness.

## Reference Style (Example Only)

Below is a description of the preferred style: a cartoon avatar with expressive, realistic eyes
and mouth, soft shading, and gentle looping motion. The avatar must remain friendly,
approachable, and suitable for autistic children.

## Prototype Requirements

1. Dynamic Avatar (Motion-Based)
- Cartoon avatar with realistic child-friendly facial features
- Smooth motion (blinking, waving, head turn)
- At least one transition (idle → wave, wave → nod)
- Emotion-based response motions
- Minimum animation length: 3 seconds

1. AI-Driven Short Interaction
- Avatar initiates simple prompt (ex: “Hi, my name is…”)
- User responds via tap, voice, or both
- Avatar reacts with motion, expression, and optional audio
- AI must produce at least 2–3 branching outcomes
- Must use natural language (not only scripted)
- Interaction must relate to project scope (e.g., brushing teeth guidance)

## Technical Specifications
- Vite.js/Vanilla JavaScript for frontend development
- Three.js/WebGL for avatar rendering
- Gemini API for AI dialog generation

In addition, you may use any open source libraries you find suitable to achieve the requirements

## Evaluation Criteria

- Avatar creativity & visual appeal
- Animation smoothness
- AI dialog branching quality
- Technical delivery quality
- Professional communication
- Overall clarity and completeness
